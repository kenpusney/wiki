        <h1 id="software-leadership-4-slow-down-to-speed-up">Software Leadership #4: Slow Down to Speed Up</h1>
<p>April 12, 2013</p>
<p>I am naturally drawn to teams that work at an insane pace. The momentum, and persistent drive to increase that momentum, generates amazing results. And it’s crazy fun.</p>
<p>In such environments, however, I’ve found one thing to be a constant struggle for everybody on the team – leaders, managers, and individual doers alike: remembering to take the necessary time to do the right thing. This sounds obvious, but it’s very easy to lose sight of this important principle when deadlines loom, customers and managers and shareholders demand, and the overall team is running ahead at a breakneak pace.</p>
<p>A nice phrase I learned from a past manager of mine was, “sometimes you need to slow down to speed up.”</p>
<p>By taking shortcuts today, though attractive in that they help meet that next closest deadline, you almost always pay for them down the road. You might subsequently become quagmired in bugs because quality was comprimised from the outset. You may create a platform that others build upon, only to realize later that the architecture is wrong in need of revamping, incurring a ripple effect on an entire software stack. You may realize that your whole system performs poorly under load, such that just when your startup was beginning to skyrocket to success, users instead flee due to the poor experience. The manifestation differs, but the root cause is the same.</p>
<p>The level of quality you need for a project is very specific to your technology and business. I’ll admit that working on systems software demands different quality standards than web software, for example. And the quality demands change as a project matures, when the focus shifts from writing reams of new code to modifying existing code… although the early phases are in fact the most challenging: this is when the most critical cultural traits are not yet set but are developing, when things have the highest risk of getting set off in the wrong direction, and is when you are most likely to scrimp on quality due to the need to make rapid progress on a broad set of problems all at once.</p>
<p>So how do you ensure people end up doing the right thing? Well, I’d be lying if I didn’t say it is a real challenge.</p>
<p>As a leader, it is important to create a culture where individuals get rewarded for doing the right thing. Nothing beats having a team full of folks that “self-police” themselves using a shared set of demanding principles.</p>
<p>To achieve this, leaders needs to be consistent, demanding, and hyper-aware of what’s going on around them. You need to be able to recognize quality versus junk, so that you can reward the right people. You need to set up a culture where critical feedback when shortcuts are being taken is “okay” and “expected.” I’ve made my beliefs pretty evident in prior articles, however I simply don’t believe you can do this right in the early days without being highly technical yourself. As a team grows, your attention to technical detail may get stretched thin, in which case you need to scale by adding new technical leaders that share, recognize, and maintain or advance these cultural traits.</p>
<p>You also can’t punish people for getting less done than they could have if they took those shortcuts. Many cultures reward those who hammer out large quantities of poorly written code. You get what you reward.</p>
<p>In fact, you must do the opposite, by making an example out of the people who check in crappy code.</p>
<p>Facebook has this slogan “move fast and break things.” It may seem that what I’m saying above is at odds with that famous slogan. Indeed they are somewhat contradictory, however paradoxically they are also highly complementary. Although you need to slow down to do the right thing, you do also need to keep moving fast. If that seems impossible, it’s not; but it sure is difficult to find the right balance.</p>
<p>I have a belief that I’m almost embarassed to admit: I believe that most people are incredibly lazy. I think most quality comprimise stems from an inherent laziness that leads to details being glossed over, even if they are consciously recognized as needing attention. The best developers maintain this almost supernatural drive that comes from somewhere deep within, and they use this drive to stave off the laziness. If you’re moving fast and writing a lot of code, strive to utilize every ounce of intellectual horsepower you can muster – sustained, for the entire time you are writing code. Even if that’s for 16 hours straight. If at any moment a thought occurs that might save you time down the road, stop, ponder it, course correct on the fly. This is a way of “slowing down to speed up” but in a way where you can still be moving fast. Many lazier people let these fleeting thoughts go without exploring them fully. They will consciously do the wrong thing because doing the right thing takes more time.</p>
<p>I’ve developed odd habits over the years. As a compile runs, I literally pore over every modified line of code, wondering if there’s a better way to do it. If I see something, I push it on the stack and make sure to come back to it. By the time I’ve actually commited some new code – regardless of whether it’s 10,000 lines of freshly written code, or a 10 line modification to some existing stuff – chances are that I’ve read each line of code at least three times. I disallow any detail I see to slip through the cracks. And my mind obsesses over all aspects of my work, even during “off times” (e.g., eating dinner, walking down the hallway, etc). Each of these opportunities represents a chance to slow down, reflect, and course correct.</p>
<p>Do I still miss thing? Sure I do. But that’s why it’s so critical to have a team around you who shares the same principles and will help to identify any shortcomings that I’ve missed.</p>
<p>Another practice I encourage on my team is fixing broken windows. I’m sure folks are aware of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows" title="null">broken windows theory</a>, where neighborhoods in which broken windows are tolerated tend to accumulate more and more broken windows with time. It happens in code, too. If people are discouraged from stopping to fix the broken windows, you will end up with lots of them. And guess what, each broken window actually slows you down. As more and more accumulate, it can become a real chore to get anything meaningful done. I guarantee you will not be able to move very fast if too many broken windows pile up and start needing attention. Slowing down to fix them incrementally, as soon as they are noticed, speeds you up down the road.</p>
<p>Building a quality-focused team isn’t easy. But creating a culture that slows down to do the right thing, while simultaneously moving fast, provides an enormous competitive advantage. It’s not as common as you might think.</p>
