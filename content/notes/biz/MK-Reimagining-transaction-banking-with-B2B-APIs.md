## B2B integration: The state of play

We see six major challenges around file-based integration:

- limited exception handling on format mismatches
- manual failure recovery following network or system outages
- weak controls for file tampering and man-in-the-middle breaches
- long customer onboarding timesâ€”as much as four to six months
- bulky file formats for enterprise resource planning (ERP) integration, requiring customization for each corporate
- higher operating cost to run and maintain the specialized software needed

## Building a B2B API platform: Five success factors

1. Embrace a product development mindset
  - Design for process control and orchestration
  - Weigh tradeoffs between a channel and product approach
2. Set up a modern API lifecycle management platform
  - API gateway
  - API publisher
  - API store and development portal
  - API analytics
3. Extend risk management and optional controls to API-based offerings
  - Align security and regulatory controls
  - Amend client undertakings and legal contracts
4. Leverage partnerships and self-service solution for customer acquisition
  - Form partnership with software-as-a-service finance companies
  - Simplify customer onboarding
5. Define an API taxonomy to accurately access system readiness, avoid proliferation of incompatible APIs, and prioritize for business value
  - Experience APIs
  - Process APIs
  - System APIs
  - Experience APIs should be owned by channel teams and process APIs by business owners. System APIs should be controlled by application owners.
