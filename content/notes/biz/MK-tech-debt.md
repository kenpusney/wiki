## What is tech debt

- The **principal**（本金） is all the work that must be done to modernize the entire technology stack.
  - deferred maintenance or upgrades below the app layer,
  - modifications to comply with data standards,
  - and bespoke packaged software
- The **interest**（利息） is the complexity tax that every project pays today.
  - work through fragile point-to-point or batch data integrations,
  - harmonize nonstandard data,
  - and create workarounds to confront risk and meet business needs.

> Tech-debt principal accounts for up to 40 percent of IT balance sheets, while most companies pay more than 10 percent interest on projects.
