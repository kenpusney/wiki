# Data Science for Beginners

5 problems can be anwser:

 - Is this A or B?
 - Is this weird?
 - How much / how many?
 - How is this organized?
 - What should I do now?


Algorithms
  - Is this A or B => Classification algorithms
  - Is this weird => Anomaly detection algorithms
  - How much / how many => Regression algorithms
  - How is this organized => Clustering Algorithms
  - What should I do now: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Data Criteria

  - Relevant
  - Connected
  - Accurate
  - Enough to work with

## Ask right question

  - Ask sharp question
  - Anwser with target data
  - Reformulate Question
