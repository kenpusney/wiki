=======

## News

Here comes a **BRAND NEW** wiki built by [wiki:ReactJS]().
Checkout [github:kenpusney/wikisource]() and [github:kenpusney/wikiflow](), see how it works.

## Guides

You can get started from the [:tech]() topics or [:non-tech]() topics.

Here is the list of categories in this site:

 - [:article]()
 - [:project]()
 - [:idea]()
 - [:spec]()
 - [:doc]()

## My Interests

I am interested in [:tech/Programming Language]()s and their implementation, also
have strong interests about automation and tools for [:tech/Software Engineering]().

Lots of things I am working on belong to these areas.

You can also see my [:publications]() here.

## About this wiki

see [:meta]() page for details about this page.
