## News

Here comes a **BRAND NEW** wiki built by [wiki:ReactJS]().
Checkout [github:kenpusney/wikisource]() and [github:kenpusney/wikiflow](), see how it works.

## Guides

You can get started from the [:Tech Stuff]()s or [:Non-Tech Stuff]()s.

Here is the list of categories in this site:

 - Articles: [:article]()
 - Projects: [:project]()
 - Ideas: [:idea]()
 - Specifications: [:spec]()
 - Documentations: [:doc]()

## My Interests

I am interested in [:Programming Language]()s and their implementation, also
have strong interests about automation and tools for [:Software Engineering]().

Lots of things I am working on belong to these areas.
