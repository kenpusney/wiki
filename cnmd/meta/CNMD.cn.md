Let's say if you want link an item exists in Wikipedia, you can just add
a normal link, but with a `wiki:` prefix like `[wiki:Markdown]()`, it
means that you want link this page to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown`.

For internal items(like in wikipedia, it's single page for one item),
just put an `:` as a prefix, e.g. `[:about me]()` ([:about me]()).
